#### Mark Hibbing CIS 345 Tues/Thurs 12:00 - 1:15pm Project Project Submission ####

This project requires:

 - a Discord Server with the Sounds of Sunset bot added as a super user
 - ffmpeg installed on your computer, preferably a Windows 10 PC
 - single video YouTube URLs

###Instructions###
As I begin typing this, I'm starting to realize more and more that this project
will not be functional without my assistance. While the code is gradable, too many
factors are locked by user privacy protections for independent execution

First, the bot needs to be added to a Discord server where testing can commence
(sadly only I can do this because the bot is account bound).

Second, ffmpeg needs to be properly installed on the test machine.
Website: https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases
File Used: ffmpeg-n4.4.1-2-gcc33e73618-win64-gpl-4.4
Tutorial URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1AtmY-RMyQ&t=2s

Third, main.py file needs to be run first followed by the backend_gui.py. These two
files can run concurrently based on my testing so far on my personal PC

Fourth, the bot must be added to a voice channel using the "/join" command while a
human user is also in the channel

Fifth, type in the "/play" command followed by a space and then your desired
YouTube URL. Theoretically, any YouTube video should be sufficient. However, this
project was designed specfiically for music videos of less than an hour in length

Sixth, test the "/pause" command

Seventh, test the "/resume" command

Eighth, once a song has fully completed playing, you may continue playing music.
Repeat steps 5-7 as appropriate

Ninth, test the "/disconnect" command

At this point, it would be appropriate to stop the code. If multiple tests are 
desired, please repeat steps 3-9.

The GUI, as originally intended, was meant to take URLs run through the bot and to
add them to a list. This list could be updated using the refresh button. However,
due to my inability and lack of further development, the connecting variable
between the GUI and the music bot does not function as intended. Therefore, the 
only button that will function properly on the GUI is the Exit button. I do
apologize for this rather gaping hole in the project. I've spent mutliple days on
this problem to no avail. I fully accept that I will lose points for this
section of the project.
